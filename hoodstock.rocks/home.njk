		<p>Following an awesome festival party in 2022, the HOODSTOCK team are back to welcome you to an afternoon of live music, family friendly fun and a chance to catch up with mates old and new in Hastings.</p>

		<p>Due to the epic amount of rain over the past year, the Hoods’ field wasn’t in a condition to accommodate staging and trucks etc unfortunately. We didn’t want to miss another year, so we worked hard to find a new venue and the amazing team at the <strong>Blackbox Hastings</strong> came to our rescue. When we found out it was Pirate weekend in Hastings too, our plans came together perfectly!</p>

		<p>You can look forward to seeing bands old and new playing a whole hunk of tunes you know throughout the day, a full stocked bar and activities for the kids including a pirate treasure hunt and sweet shop! As we are in the middle of George Street once you have your wristband for the day you can come and go as you please to grab food or take the kids for a quick runaround on the beach. As always, Hoodstock is not for profit, and we are only charging adults for wristbands to help us cover the costs of putting the event on. Kids are free and very welcome.</p>

		<p>So, book your tickets, grab your pirate hats and we’ll see you for some fun in the Old Town, Hastings!</p>
		<p>See you on the 20th July!</p>
