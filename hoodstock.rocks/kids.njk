		<p>The Blackbox is a smaller nightclub style venue in the centre of Hastings so it will have a slightly different space for children, but they are very welcome. We have made sure there are activities to keep the children entertained as well as the music of course!</p>

		<h2>Pirate Treasure Hunt</h2>

		<p>We can’t have a pirate themed event without some treasure! Kids can pick up a treasure hunt sheet and see if they can find all the clues around the venue to win some booty!</p>

		<h2>Sweet Shop</h2>

		<p>As we can’t have a visit from the ice-cream van we will be opening a small sweet shop during the afternoon between 3pm and 5pm. Kids can bring some small change and fill up a sweetie bag old school style!</p>

		<p>We appreciate kids may need a break from a loud indoor space, so you are very welcome to come and go throughout the event. It will be quite loud so if you do have young children, we recommend bringing ear defenders. We will have some small foam plugs which you can help yourself to if you need them.</p>
