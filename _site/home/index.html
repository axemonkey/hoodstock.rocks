		<p>Welcome to the HOODSTOCK website. We are really excited about seeing everyone on the 2nd July and enjoying catching up and enjoying live music together again after far too long.</p>

		<p>Harry &amp; Kate Hood have kindly lent us their field in Westfield for the event and we have put everything together to be family friendly so that everyone can come along and have a great day.</p>
		<p>As well as the main stage hosting many familiar bands from the 90s/00s, we will also be installing an acoustic marquee which will be set up as a tribute to <strong>John Harper</strong> who was a Hastings music legend and great supporter to many of those who will be returning to perform.</p>
		<p>On our website you can find out all the information about the event, bands and acts that will be performing, food, drink and plenty more.</p>

		<p>Please remember HOODSTOCK is a private event held at a friend’s house and must not be advertised publically. If you have the link to this website this please join us and feel free to invite friends and family who would enjoy the day.</p>

		<p><strong>Anyone who wishes to come to HOODSTOCK will need to register beforehand</strong>. Please see our <a href="/info">tickets page</a> for details.</p>

		<p>See you on the 2nd July!</p>
