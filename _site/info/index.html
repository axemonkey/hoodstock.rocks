		<p>Everyone who wishes to attend HOODSTOCK at the Blackbox (including children) will need to have a ticket in advance so you can collect your wristband on the day.</p>

		<p><strong>Tickets are available to order from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hoodstock-at-the-blackbox-tickets-912697050447">Eventbrite</a>.</strong></p>

		<h2>Getting There</h2>

		<p>The Blackbox is based in George Street in the centre of Hastings Old Town. It’s about a 15-minute walk from Hastings train station.</p>

		<p>If you are planning on driving, there are a few car parks around the Hastings old town area or at Priory Meadow shopping centre in the main town centre of Hastings. Hastings is likely to be very busy that day so leave plenty of time to get to the car parks.</p>
