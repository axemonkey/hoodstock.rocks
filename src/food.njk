		<p>As we are in <a href="https://www.blackboxhastings.com/">a licensed venue</a> this year the bar will be fully stocked! We are working with the venue to make sure there are suitable drinks available for kids.</p>

		<p>Food wise, feel free to pop out during the day and grab something to eat. The venue are happy for people to bring small takeaway food (e.g. fish and chips) in to the venue, but please make sure all rubbish is disposed of in the bins.</p>
